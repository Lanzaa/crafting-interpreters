The [Curry-Howard isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) is fascinating.


Q. What language do I want to use to implement?

The book uses Java as the main language, but I don't want to.


Options:
* Python
  * + Python is easy.
* Rust
  * + Rust is something I have wanted to learn.
* Julia
  * + Julia seems like a good language to learn for ML.
* Erlang
  * + Erlang's VM and paradigm are thought provoking.
* Elixir
  * + Elixir uses Erlang's VM
  * + [HNews recommendation for web stack is PETAL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34538138)
* C#
  * + Already learning
* F#
  * + Seems interesting to learn. Similar to Scala in many ways
* Scala
  * + Easy, I like the paradigm



"By the end of part II, we’ll have a simple, readable implementation. It’s not very fast, but it’s correct. However, we are only able to accomplish that by building on the Java virtual machine’s own runtime facilities."

Q. Does that mean I need to target the JVM?
